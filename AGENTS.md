# AI Agent Guidelines

This document serves as the primary instruction manual for AI agents working on the SwissArmyNES codebase. Strictly adhere to these guidelines to ensure consistency, quality, and stability.

## Core Directives

1.  **Strict Design Adherence**: The `DESIGN.md` file is the master roadmap. Do not deviate from the current phase or the specified architecture without explicit user approval.
2.  **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: This is a Rust application. It must compile and run on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification. Avoid OS-specific commands or paths.
3.  **Documentation**:
    - Update `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and this `AGENTS.md` file whenever major changes occur.
    - Do not remove existing comments unless they are factually incorrect or the code they describe is deleted.
    - Add clear, concise comments to all new code, explaining the "why" more than the "what".
4.  **Testing**:
    - "Test Constantly" is the mantra. Run tests after every significant code change.
    - You are permitted to modify existing test files (`tests/`) if your changes legitimately break old tests (e.g., changing an API).
    - Create new tests for every new feature or bug fix.
5.  **Code Quality**:
    - **Formatting**: All code must pass `cargo fmt`.
    - **Linting**: All code must pass `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`. Address all warnings immediately.
    - **Dead Code**: While `dead_code` warnings might be suppressed in CI, strive to minimize unused code.

## Project Structure

-   `src/lib.rs`: The library entry point. Contains the compiler core and server logic modules.
-   `src/main.rs`: The binary entry point. Sets up the Axum server and handles command-line args.
-   `src/compiler/`: All compiler logic (Lexer, Parser, AST, Symbol Table, Codegen, Audio).
-   `src/server/`: Backend logic (API endpoints, project file management).
-   `static/`: The frontend (HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS).
-   `projects/`: Local storage for user projects (git-ignored, but structure matters).
-   `tests/`: Integration tests.

## Development Workflow

1.   **Read Brain section in AGENTS.md**: Pick back up where the last AI agent left off.
2.  **Plan**: Read the requirements, verify the state of the code, and formulate a plan using `set_plan`.
3.  **Edit**: Make changes.
4.  **Verify**:
    - Run `cargo check` to catch compilation errors early.
    - Run `cargo fmt` to fix style.
    - Run `cargo clippy` to ensure quality.
    - Run `cargo test` to verify functionality.
5.  **Refine**: If tests fail, diagnose and fix. Do not guess. Use `read_file` to see the actual code.
6.  **Store current state in Brain section of AGENTS.md**: Help the next AI agent out by telling them what has been done and what should be done next, allong with pitfalls to look out for.
7.  **Submit**: Only when all checks pass.

## Technical specifics

-   **Assembler**: The project uses `rs6502` for assembly generation. Be aware of its limitations (e.g., no `.BYTE` directive support, use `db` equivalent or injection).
-   **Frontend**: Plain HTML/JS/CSS. No build step (Webpack/Vite) is currently used. Keep it simple.
-   **Memory Management**: The NES has 2KB of RAM. The compiler must manage this strictly (`$0000-$07FF`).

## Brain
Phase 5 (16-bit Math Expansion) is complete.
- **Implemented**: 16-bit addition/subtraction, `WORD` variable assignment updates, and `generate_expression` return type refactor.
- **Details**:
    - `src/compiler/codegen.rs`: `generate_expression` now returns `Result<DataType, String>`.
    - 16-bit Integer literals are supported.
    - 8-bit values are automatically zero-extended to 16-bit when operated with 16-bit values.
    - Result of 8-bit operations ensures `X` register is 0.
- **Next Steps**:
    - Phase 6: Advanced Math (Mul/Div/Signed).
- **Pitfalls**:
    - `generate_expression` returning `DataType` means the caller must decide how to handle the result (e.g., if it's in A/X or just A).
    - `LDX #0` is emitted frequently for safety; peephole optimization (Phase 41) will clean this up later.
    - 16-bit comparisons are partially implemented; extensive testing for signed vs unsigned comparisons is needed in Phase 6.
    - `TopLevel::Include` and `preprocessor` usage remains critical for multi-file projects.
