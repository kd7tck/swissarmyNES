# AI Agent Guidelines

This document serves as the primary instruction manual for AI agents working on the SwissArmyNES codebase. Strictly adhere to these guidelines to ensure consistency, quality, and stability.

## Core Directives

1.  **Strict Design Adherence**: The `DESIGN.md` file is the master roadmap. Do not deviate from the current phase or the specified architecture without explicit user approval.
2.  **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: This is a Rust application. It must compile and run on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification. Avoid OS-specific commands or paths.
3.  **Documentation**:
    - Update `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and this `AGENTS.md` file whenever major changes occur.
    - Do not remove existing comments unless they are factually incorrect or the code they describe is deleted.
    - Add clear, concise comments to all new code, explaining the "why" more than the "what".
4.  **Testing**:
    - "Test Constantly" is the mantra. Run tests after every significant code change.
    - You are permitted to modify existing test files (`tests/`) if your changes legitimately break old tests (e.g., changing an API).
    - Create new tests for every new feature or bug fix.
5.  **Code Quality**:
    - **Formatting**: All code must pass `cargo fmt`.
    - **Linting**: All code must pass `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`. Address all warnings immediately.
    - **Dead Code**: While `dead_code` warnings might be suppressed in CI, strive to minimize unused code.

## Project Structure

-   `src/lib.rs`: The library entry point. Contains the compiler core and server logic modules.
-   `src/main.rs`: The binary entry point. Sets up the Axum server and handles command-line args.
-   `src/compiler/`: All compiler logic (Lexer, Parser, AST, Symbol Table, Codegen, Audio).
-   `src/server/`: Backend logic (API endpoints, project file management).
-   `static/`: The frontend (HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS).
-   `projects/`: Local storage for user projects (git-ignored, but structure matters).
-   `tests/`: Integration tests.

## Development Workflow

1.   **Read Brain section in AGENTS.md**: Pick back up where the last AI agent left off.
2.  **Plan**: Read the requirements, verify the state of the code, and formulate a plan using `set_plan`.
3.  **Edit**: Make changes.
4.  **Verify**:
    - Run `cargo check` to catch compilation errors early.
    - Run `cargo fmt` to fix style.
    - Run `cargo clippy` to ensure quality.
    - Run `cargo test` to verify functionality.
5.  **Refine**: If tests fail, diagnose and fix. Do not guess. Use `read_file` to see the actual code.
6.  **Store current state in Brain section of AGENTS.md**: Help the next AI agent out by telling them what has been done and what should be done next, allong with pitfalls to look out for.
7.  **Submit**: Only when all checks pass.

## Technical specifics

-   **Assembler**: The project uses `rs6502` for assembly generation. Be aware of its limitations (e.g., no `.BYTE` directive support, use `db` equivalent or injection).
-   **Frontend**: Plain HTML/JS/CSS. No build step (Webpack/Vite) is currently used. Keep it simple.
-   **Memory Management**: The NES has 2KB of RAM. The compiler must manage this strictly (`$0000-$07FF`).

## Brain
Phase 4 (Multi-File Projects) is complete.
- **Implemented**: `INCLUDE` directive, recursive parsing, file management API, and Frontend Project Explorer.
- **Details**:
    - Backend: `src/server/project.rs` now supports `list_files`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `delete_file`.
    - API: `GET /api/projects/:name/files`, `POST /files`, etc. `compile` endpoint updated to support project-based compilation (reading files from disk).
    - Frontend: Project Explorer now lists files. Users can create, switch, and save files.
    - Compilation: "Run" now saves the current file (and assets) and requests compilation of the project (using `main.swiss` as entry point by default).
- **Next Steps**:
    - Phase 5: 16-bit Math Expansion (Update CodeGen for 16-bit operations).
- **Pitfalls**:
    - `TopLevel::Dim` signature changed to include `Option<Expression>`. Any new tests creating AST nodes manually must account for this.
    - `TopLevel::Include` added. `preprocessor::process_includes` MUST be called before Analysis/Codegen.
    - The compiler relies on `main.swiss` being the entry point when compiling a project. `INCLUDE`s are resolved relative to the project root.
    - `save_project` API (legacy) is still used for assets but `source` field in it updates `main.swiss` specifically. New file APIs should be used for source code.
