# AI Agent Guidelines

This document serves as the primary instruction manual for AI agents working on the SwissArmyNES codebase. Strictly adhere to these guidelines to ensure consistency, quality, and stability.

## Core Directives

1.  **Strict Design Adherence**: The `DESIGN.md` file is the master roadmap. Do not deviate from the current phase or the specified architecture without explicit user approval.
2.  **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: This is a Rust application. It must compile and run on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification. Avoid OS-specific commands or paths.
3.  **Documentation**:
    - Update `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and this `AGENTS.md` file whenever major changes occur.
    - Do not remove existing comments unless they are factually incorrect or the code they describe is deleted.
    - Add clear, concise comments to all new code, explaining the "why" more than the "what".
4.  **Testing**:
    - "Test Constantly" is the mantra. Run tests after every significant code change.
    - You are permitted to modify existing test files (`tests/`) if your changes legitimately break old tests (e.g., changing an API).
    - Create new tests for every new feature or bug fix.
5.  **Code Quality**:
    - **Formatting**: All code must pass `cargo fmt`.
    - **Linting**: All code must pass `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`. Address all warnings immediately.
    - **Dead Code**: While `dead_code` warnings might be suppressed in CI, strive to minimize unused code.

## Project Structure

-   `src/lib.rs`: The library entry point. Contains the compiler core and server logic modules.
-   `src/main.rs`: The binary entry point. Sets up the Axum server and handles command-line args.
-   `src/compiler/`: All compiler logic (Lexer, Parser, AST, Symbol Table, Codegen, Audio).
-   `src/server/`: Backend logic (API endpoints, project file management).
-   `static/`: The frontend (HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS).
-   `projects/`: Local storage for user projects (git-ignored, but structure matters).
-   `tests/`: Integration tests.

## Development Workflow

1.   **Read Brain section in AGENTS.md**: Pick back up where the last AI agent left off.
2.  **Plan**: Read the requirements, verify the state of the code, and formulate a plan using `set_plan`.
3.  **Edit**: Make changes.
4.  **Verify**:
    - Run `cargo check` to catch compilation errors early.
    - Run `cargo fmt` to fix style.
    - Run `cargo clippy` to ensure quality.
    - Run `cargo test` to verify functionality.
5.  **Refine**: If tests fail, diagnose and fix. Do not guess. Use `read_file` to see the actual code.
6.  **Store current state in Brain section of AGENTS.md**: Help the next AI agent out by telling them what has been done and what should be done next, allong with pitfalls to look out for.
7.  **Submit**: Only when all checks pass.

## Technical specifics

-   **Assembler**: The project uses `rs6502` for assembly generation. Be aware of its limitations (e.g., no `.BYTE` directive support, use `db` equivalent or injection).
-   **Frontend**: Plain HTML/JS/CSS. No build step (Webpack/Vite) is currently used. Keep it simple.
-   **Memory Management**: The NES has 2KB of RAM. The compiler must manage this strictly (`$0000-$07FF`).

## Brain
Phase 2 (String Data Support) is largely complete.
- **Implemented**: `DataType::String` in AST/SymbolTable, `DIM name AS STRING = "Literal"` parsing, and CodeGen support using a dedicated String Data segment (RO-DATA) containing `db` directives.
- **Constraint**: `rs6502` assembler does not support `#<Label` for immediate loading of label addresses. To workaround this, we generate string data labels and store pointers to them in the Data Table at `$FF00`. Initialization code reads these pointers using `LDA $FFxx` and stores them in the variable's RAM address (2 bytes).
- **Next Steps**:
    - Phase 3: Data Tables (DATA/READ).
    - Or expand String support for `PRINT` (Phase 12 uses Text Engine).
- **Pitfalls**:
    - `TopLevel::Dim` signature changed to include `Option<Expression>`. Any new tests creating AST nodes manually must account for this.
    - String literals in expressions (e.g. `Call("Hello")`) are NOT yet supported in CodeGen (they parse, but CodeGen will fail or produce incorrect results because it doesn't allocate the string literal encountered in expressions). Currently only `DIM` initialization allocates string data.
